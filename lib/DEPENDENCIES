Simple Java XML Parser - Library Dependencies
---------------------------------------------

* junit-4.8.2.jar - As expected, this library is only needed in the classpath
	at runtime if you plan on running the test cases. For normal deployment
	into production, you can leave junit off your classpath.
	
* xpp3-1.1.4c.jar - This library provides the default implementation for the
	XML Pull Parsing spec that SJXP will use. You need this library in your
	classpath in all cases *except* when deploying SJXP inside of an Android
	application.
	
	Conveniently enough the Android runtime already provides an
	XML Pull Parser implementation (it is a modified version of XPP3) so you can
	just ship the tiny sjxp JAR with your Android app and that's all you need.
